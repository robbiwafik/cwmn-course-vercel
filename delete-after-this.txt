Optimizing Images

Optimizing image using the Image component in Next.js

This component is built on top of the standard img element in html
Under the hood it automatically compresses and resizes our images based on the device size
Props: 
    src -> good for images that is local to our application (e.g. logo) (@ -> root of the application)
        -> url for remote images - always provide dimensions
    alt -> describe the image
    width
    height
    fill -> for responsive image
    style -> objectFit cover objectFit contain -> better approach is to use tailwind
    sizes -> determines how much of the width of the viewport the image is going to take - (max-width: 480px) it's not gonna impact what we see on the screen
    quality -> 1 - 100
    priority

    parent element should be relative, absolute, fixed -> fill
    parent element should have height
